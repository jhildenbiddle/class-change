A versatile [Element.classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.classList) alternative for manipulating CSS class names, triggering class change events using HTML data attributes, and creating class-related event listeners using a simple, declarative API.

- [Documentation](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/class-change)
- [Codepen Demo](https://codepen.io/jhildenbiddle/pen/wvmYVML)

## Why?

CSS class names change. A lot.

Native methods for manipulating CSS class names are rudimentary given how often we need them. [Element.classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.classList) provides a basic API for working with classes, but changes can only be applied to a single element and separate event listeners must be created for each class change event. Legacy browsers also suffer from [incomplete implementations](http://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist) or lack support entirely. The result is unnecessary code bloat and complexity from repeated loops and boilerplate code, polyfills for legacy browsers, and potential performance issues caused by a high volume of event listeners. This micro-library addresses these issues by reducing and simplifying the code required for handling CSS class changes for modern and legacy browsers.

## Features

- Apply class changes to Arrays, CSS Selectors, HTMLCollections, and NodeLists
- Trigger class changes using HTML data attributes
- Create class change event listeners using a simple, declarative API
- Legacy browser support (IE9+)
- ES and UMD modules available
- Lightweight (1.6k min+gzip) and dependency-free
